## `[13]` TruthCert: A Fail-Closed Certification Protocol for LLM Outputs in Evidence Synthesis

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: AUC  
**Data:** 50 simulated RCT extraction benchmark tasks

### 156-word body

Can a fail-closed certification protocol prevent silently incorrect LLM outputs from entering high-stakes evidence synthesis workflows? We designed TruthCert as a versioned standard requiring scope-locked estimands, per-value provenance chains, multi-witness arbitration, and immutable bundle hashing. The protocol assembles at least three independent witnesses per atomic claim, applies domain-specific validator packs across 12 extension domains, and rejects outputs with insufficient evidence. Against 50 simulated RCT extraction tasks, TruthCert rejected all 18 corrupted bundles while certifying 30 of 32 valid ones, yielding an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for certification accuracy. Adversarial injection of arm-swap errors, unit mismatches, and citation drift was detected in every case, with zero false certifications across all tested corruption types. Structured fail-closed verification transforms the LLM accuracy problem from trusting model confidence into auditing evidence completeness with mandatory disclosure. The protocol does not extend to free-text clinical interpretation, and validator threshold calibration may not generalize across medical specialties without domain expert tuning.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
